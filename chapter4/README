1. for chapter4 Makefile, if put ccflags-y just before target modules, the ccflags-y will not work.
if I put ccflags-y at the head of the Makefile, it works. don't know why. 

2. even if change the current loglevel of /proc/sys/kernel/printk to 8, I cannot see the PDEBUG message
 to show on the screen. it works only when I login by terminal using CTRL+ALT+F1. I think it maybe 
because ubuntu is login as graphical interface. using CTRL+ALT+F7 can switch to graphical interface.
