1. currently, scull.c will not make device node. After insmod scull.ko,
you will not find /dev/scullx. Instead, you can use scull_load script 
to insmod the scull.ko, get the major number and make the device node.

examples:
	1. sudo ./scull_load.sh
	2. cat /proc/devices | grep scull
	3. ls -al /dev/scull*
	4. sudo ./scull_unload.sh
	5. cat /proc/devices | grep scull
	6. ls -al /dev/scull*

please refer to "Dynamic Allocation of Major Numbers" of chapter 3.
